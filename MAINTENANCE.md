# Boeing Aircraft Maintenance Report System
## Design & Implementation Plan

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the design and implementation plan for a maintenance report management system for Boeing aircraft. The system will ingest maintenance reports, classify them according to ATA Spec 100 and iSpec 2200 standards, store them in a vector database, and provide a RAG-powered interface for natural language queries.

    # Parse PostgreSQL credentials
    postgres = vcap.get('postgresql', [{}])[0]
    db_credentials = postgres.get('credentials', {})
    
    # Parse GenAI service
    genai = vcap.get('genai-service', [{}])[0]
    genai_credentials = genai.get('credentials', {})
    
    return {
        'database_url': construct_db_url(db_credentials),
        'genai_api_key': genai_credentials.get('api_key'),
        'genai_base_url': genai_credentials.get('base_url')
    }
```

### 2. GenAI Model Discovery

```python
from openai import OpenAI

class GenAIClient:
    def __init__(self, api_key: str, base_url: str):
        self.client = OpenAI(
            api_key=api_key,
            base_url=base_url
        )
    
    async def discover_models(self):
        models = await self.client.models.list()
        return {
            'chat_models': [m for m in models if 'chat' in m.id],
            'embedding_models': [m for m in models if 'embed' in m.id]
        }
```

        '21': 'Air Conditioning',
        '27': 'Flight Controls',
        '32': 'Landing Gear',
        '52': 'Doors',
        '53': 'Fuselage',
        '57': 'Wings',
        # ... complete ATA chapter mapping
    }
    
    def classify(self, report_text: str) -> str:
        # Implement classification logic
        # Could use keyword matching, regex, or ML model
        pass

- **Generation Quality**: Context-aware responses with proper source citations
- **Safety Handling**: Specialized processing for safety-critical queries
- **System Reliability**: 100% test pass rate with comprehensive error handling

### Sample RAG Query Processing

```json
{
  "query_text": "What hydraulic issues have been reported in landing gear?",
  "response": "Based on the maintenance reports, hydraulic issues have been identified in the landing gear system (ATA Chapter 32). The most common problem is hydraulic leaks at actuator connections, often caused by seal deterioration and corrosion. These issues are typically classified as minor severity but require prompt attention to prevent system failures.",
  "sources": [
    {
      "report_id": "test_report_1",
      "aircraft_model": "Boeing 737-800",
      "ata_chapter": "32",
      "ata_chapter_name": "Landing Gear",
      "similarity_score": 0.95,
      "excerpt": "Found hydraulic leak at nose gear actuator. B-nut connection showing signs of corrosion...",
      "safety_critical": "false",
      "severity": "minor"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "processing_time_ms": 150,
    "total_sources_considered": 2,
    "confidence_score": 0.85,
